## Security Issue must be addressed 
- heap/stack overflow 
- Trust the service in TCB  
## WHy Syncchronous IPC is bad? 

## No lock on the dest PT? 
- Lock tension slow down? 
## Should mention EPT slow down 
## Violation of Process Management 
- If the share buffer is mark only one process, then how it invoke back to sub-kernel to do scheling 
- It's linkable library in Linux, not IPC, or called high level-RPC ?
